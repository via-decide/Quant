You are working in repository via-decide/Quant on branch main.

MISSION
Implement a deterministic historical simulator called via-quant-backtester to evaluate trading strategies. 1. Create src/core/backtest/. 2. Implement HistoricalDataFeeder.ts to stream Parquet files directly into the RingBuffer. 3. Create an EventEngine.ts to sequentially process Market, Signal, Order, and Fill events deterministically. 4. Implement SimulatedExchange.ts to cross orders against historical L2 data, simulating latency and slippage. 5. Build AccountTracker.ts to maintain a running ledger of cash and margin. 6. Implement a MetricsEngine.ts to calculate Max Drawdown, Beta, and Sharpe Ratio.

CONSTRAINTS
Ensure absolute parity between the Backtesting Engine and the Live Trading Engine. Strictly forbid "lookahead bias" by tightly encapsulating the data feeder.
Implement a deterministic, zero-allocation market data ingestor and L2 Order Book called via-quant-core. 1. Create src/core/market-data/. 2. Implement OrderBook.ts using flat Float64Array buffers or WebAssembly/Rust for $O(\log n)$ insertions/deletions. 3. Create FeedHandler.ts to parse WebSocket feeds (JSON/binary) and update the book without GC pressure. 4. Implement a RingBuffer.ts (lock-free queue) to pass updates to worker threads, bypassing Node.js serialization. 5. Build OrderManager.ts to track local order states. 6. Implement a TickSnapshot.ts service to compress L2 state into a Time-Series DB (QuestDB/InfluxDB).

CONSTRAINTS
Strictly enforce zero-allocation on the hot path. Forbid new Object(), [], or JSON.parse() during the active trading loop to prevent garbage collection pauses and slippage.

PROCESS (MANDATORY)
1. Read README.md and AGENTS.md before editing.
2. Audit architecture before coding. Summarize current behavior.
3. Preserve unrelated working code. Prefer additive modular changes.
4. Implement the smallest safe change set for the stated goal.
5. Run validation commands and fix discovered issues.
6. Self-review for regressions, missing env wiring, and docs drift.
7. Return complete final file contents for every modified or created file.

SOP: PRE-MODIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
1. Adherence to Instructions: No deviations without explicit user approval.
2. Mandatory Clarification: Immediately ask if instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.
3. Proposal First: Always propose optimizations or fixes before implementing them.
4. Scope Discipline: Do not add unrequested features or modify unrelated code.
5. Vulnerability Check: Immediately flag and explain security risks.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Include: implementation summary, checks run, risks, rollback notes.
- Generate branch + PR package.
- Keep prompts deterministic and preservation-first.
